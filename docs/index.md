# Welcome to the `ah2ac2` Library Documentation

This is the documentation for the Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2). The objective of AH2AC2 is to facilitate the development of AI agents capable of effective collaboration with human-like partners, especially in scenarios with limited prior interaction data. 
AH2AC2 is designed to benchmark and drive progress in this area.

## Navigating These Docs

This documentation provides comprehensive information for using the `ah2ac2` library and understanding how you can participate in the associated challenge. You will find the following sections:

## The AH2AC2 Challenge

The Ad-Hoc Human-AI Coordination Challenge (AH2AC2) provides a standardized environment for evaluating AI agents on their ability to coordinate with human-like counterparts in Hanabi. 
The challenge emphasizes data-efficient methods and uses human proxy agents for robust and reproducible evaluation.
